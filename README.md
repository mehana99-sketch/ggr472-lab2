# What was practiced in lab 2?

- Using external GeoJSON data sources, and getting a URL from **Github pages**.
- Delving into more of **javascript**.
- **Mapbox** styling, and exploring Mapbox's **cartogram** feature.
- Playing with formatting: map display (including height), point styling.

### Possible extensions: 
- Navbar leading to interesting information on some POIs, images of some POIs, and background on StrollTO.
- Additional data layer: city bike stations, trails, etc.
- More interactivity: toggle-able legend, pop-up with details for each POI, including buffers (eg. POIs within a certain distance of a given parking spot).
- Styling:
-     Changing colours of individual words - only "Points of Interest" displayed green. What would be the simplest way to do this?
-     Adding borders to points for better visibility
