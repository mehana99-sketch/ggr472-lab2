At this time, Toronto Island was actually a peninsula connected to the mainland near the mouth of the Don River. A violent storm in April 1858 permanently severed the island from the mainland, creating the now 300-metre wide Eastern Gap. Most of the ferries still operating to the island today are diesel boats constructed between 1935 and 1960. One vessel, the Trillium, is over 100 years old, and is the only sidewheel paddle steamer still sailing in North America! While ferry services operate to 2 other different points on the island for much of the year (Centre Island and Hanlan's Point), Ward's Island is the only dock that offers year-round service.

Ward's son William built a hotel in 1882, which spurred development on the land around it. Many of the plots here originally featured small, crowded tents that island-goers set up in the summer months. The City granted permission to replace these tents with houses in the 1930s, which explains the relatively small lot sizes of the homes today. In the 1960s, local government decided Toronto Island should be turned entirely into parkland, and the homes here were threatened with demolition. A lengthy legal battle ensued, which was ultimately won by Ward's Island residents, with their property rights preserved under a special piece of legislation passed in 1993. About 250 homes remain on Ward's Island today, housing approximately 600 residents. Many of these homes are unique from almost any others found in Toronto, located on tightly-packed, tiny plots of land and most featuring a humble, cottage-style look.", "Link_URL": "https://www.toronto.ca/data/parks/prd/facilities/complex/2039/index.html" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [ -79.35517779, 43.63269888 ] ] } },

In 1840, Jean du Petit Pont de la Haye bought one hundred acres located on the tip of northwest Etobicoke and, in 1849, registered a plan to subdivide part of the land into a village he named Claireville, after his eldest daughter. In 1846, the Albion Plank Road Company began to build a plank toll road from Weston to Bolton and included toll houses along the way to house fare collectors. Plank roads were expensive to maintain and, after a decade, the roads were gradually changed to gravel. The toll roads could not compete with railways for the transportation of goods and there were no toll keepers recorded in Claireville by 1878. By 1880, the Albion Plank Road Company had dissolved. The building now houses a transport company.

White pine's needles grow in clusters of five; the confederacy was originally comprised of five nations, and so, the Peacemaker's decision to choose white pine to symbolize unity was based out of that human to non-human relation. Indigenous knowledge often intertwines what is found naturally, into something that is found in teachable moments; in short Indigenous knowledge is very allegorical, and uses abstract ideas of nature to convey practical and sometimes spiritual ideas. Often times this proved to be quite an effective way of improving remembrance and discerning distinct ideas more effectively than by simply reading something and imagining what it could be.

Old Mill Bridge is one of the few bridges along the Humber River designated as a heritage property under the Ontario Heritage Act. The concrete piers and cement-clad steel arches with thick walls and stone facing gave the bridge enough strength to survive Hurricane Hazel. It was built from a design prepared by Frank Barber, consulting engineer and Vaughan Township Engineer, who also built a truss bridge at Lambton Mills further up the river. While the bridge looks like a traditional stone arched bridge, Barber's use of concrete in the design of the bridge was a major departure from the traditional method of constructing. The bridge was also used as a filming location in the first season of 'The Handmaid's Tale' for the episode titled 'The Bridge'.", "Link_URL": "https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/festivals-events/cultural-hotspot/cultural-hotspot-tours/cultural-hotspot-tour-detail?id=ET24&title=Old-Mill-Bridge&stop=17" }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [ -79.49140439, 43.65140156 ] ] } },

The duo forced the six employees and one patron into the bank basement before making off with $1954 in cash and a revolver from the bank security. Boyd would continue to pull off bank robberies in Toronto over the next two years before being arrested in 1952, but not before earning a level of fame and infamy as the namesake of the Boyd Gang.

Benjamin Brown purchased the building in 1904 and it was known as Brown's Store until 1921. In the early 1920s, it was sold to George and William Dempsey and came to be known as the Dempsey Brothers Hardware Store. It was a very familiar North York landmark. The store was relocated to this present location in 1996 and is now home to the Shining Through Centre, which provides services to children with autism and their families. In Dempsey Park, several pieces of art are installed along the park's pathways. This installation is called 'Timetrack' and it reminds visitors of the site's past as part of the Gibson family farm.

The first veteran patients were admitted in 1946, and two years later, Sunnybrook Military Hospital officially opened. By the 1960s, the number of beds required for veterans had declined, but the need to provide veterans with continuing care facilities remained. The hospital and its lands were subsequently transferred to the University of Toronto, and in 1966 it became Sunnybrook Medical Centre, the first tertiary care teaching centre in Ontario. Today, Sunnybrook houses the largest veterans care centre in Canada, providing care to 500 war veterans.", "Link_URL": null }, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [ -79.37487651, 43.72360862 ] ] } },

The area was connected to the Toronto Islands archipelago until 1858, when a storm created a break in the land. The Port Lands were used as a waste disposal site from the mid to late nineteenth century, with companies such as Gooderham and Worts using it for farm and distillery waste. In 1912, to address health concerns, the Toronto Harbour Commission began developing the area for shipping, draining and filling in the marsh with the hope of making the area a major industrial hub; however, most industries had left the area by the 1970s. In the early 2000s, film studios were built in the area, and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (now Waterfront Toronto) planned to redevelop what had become the largest underdeveloped and underused space in North America. The Port Lands is home to a number of sailing clubs, and the Martin Goodman trail - named for a former editor-in-chief of the Toronto Star newspaper - connects the area to other waterfront destinations such as Cherry Beach.

This point along the Don River is where the Davenport trail, perhaps the most prominent East-West First Nations trail in the Toronto area, crossed the Don River and turned South-Eastward towards what is now the Beaches neighborhood and then continuing Eastward along the Lake Ontario shoreline. Just west of this location, the Davenport trail was crossed by a North-South trail, one of the arms of the Toronto Carrying Place portage, that roughly followed the Don River watershed. These trails facilitated much First Nations and MÃ©tis movement through this area in the pre-colonial era, through the early fur trade, and into the nineteenth century. They also inspired the routes of their contemporary counterparts: Davenport Road and Yonge Street.  In the Don River Valley at the point of the Davenport trail crossing, wild rice (minomeen, meaning the 'good seed' in Anishinaabemowin) used to grow. Minomeen has long been a very important and culturally meaningful part of Anishinaabe foodways and diets and its growth was encouraged throughout the Great Lakes watershed. These Minomeen beds also provided important habitat and food for ducks and other waterfowl, and so it is unsurprising that many migrating ducks frequented this area. When the Mississaugas were pushed out of their lands in Toronto and the subsequent increase in various forms of industrial development along the Don River, the minomeen fields disappeared. Anishinaabe people still plant and harvest minomeen today in other areas, but this practice is threatened by global corporations and settlers that dislike minomeen beds in the lake shallows by their cottages.

He was a celebrated doctor, philanthropist, businessman, and writer. Baptized Peter Martin, Dr. O was a Residential School survivor. He studied at both the University of Oxford in England, and the Toronto School of Medicine. He earned a medical degree and became the second person registered as a Status Indian in Canada to become an MD.  Dr. O served in the Fenian Raids. He was an expert marksman who earned nine medals at the Wimbledon Shoots in England. In 1878, Dr. O joined the American based Independent Order of Foresters (IOF). He was later elected the IOF's first Supreme Chief Ranger. Throughout Dr. O's time in this role, he extended insurance benefits to the general population at a reasonable rate. Previously, insurance was only accessible to the wealthy. He was successful at leading the organization to accept women as full members in 1891, and later expanded benefits to the children of deceased members. The IOF had a member base of 369 people and a debt of $4000 when Dr. O took up his new position. By 1907, at the time of his death, the IOF's membership had grown to over a quarter of a million people across the world, as well as an impressive $11 million in liquid assets.  Dr O lived on Carlton Street here in Toronto from 1896 until 1907. When he passed away his body was laid in state at Massey Hall. Over 10,000 people came to pay their respects to Dr. Oronhyatekha. A train was then specially commissioned to carry his body to Tyendinaga Reserve for a family service.

In 1802, Givins built his home, which he called Pine Grove, on 100 of those acres, near the north end of what is now Givins Street. Givins had previously learned a number of First Nations languages, including Anishinaabemowin, and became a valuable aide and interpreter for Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe. He became an active part of the Indian Department in the 1790s, one of his responsibilities being the distribution of presents to First Nations allies. One of his other responsibilities, however, was to use divide and conquer strategies to prevent the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy from forming an alliance with Mississaugas and thereby subvert any possibility of a pan-Indigenous alliance against the British, like the previous Indigenous resistance organized under Pontiac. During the 1813 Battle of York Givins led a small band of Anishinaabe warriors and British soldiers to intercept a larger American force that landed West of Fort York near Sunnyside Beach. Being outnumbered, Givins' group suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Pine Grove, where his wife Angelica treated the wounded. After the War of 1812, he was appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs, a position he held until 1837.

Black Oak savanna, so named for its predominantly Black Oak tree cover, is particularly ecologically significant in Ontario because Black Oak is at its northern limit among the Great Lakes of southwestern Ontario.  High Park, a large park in the city's west end, contains the last remnants of a once extensive Black Oak savanna which covered much of Toronto's west end, approximately from Roncesvalles Avenue to Royal York Road and from the lakeshore as far north as Lawrence Avenue. The High Park savanna is a direct legacy of First Nations land stewardship and development. First Nations people in the Toronto area, as in many other parts of Turtle Island, employed controlled burns to maintain and expand savanna lands, which were important hunting and medicine grounds. Many First Nations trails, including the Humber arm of the Toronto Carrying Place portage criss-crossed this savanna, testifying to its long use by local First Nations people.  Unfortunately, many of the continent's savannas have disappeared or are threatened. These areas were frequently the first to be cleared and developed by European colonists for settlement and agriculture. Settler-colonial expansion also led to the suppression of controlled burns in lands formerly stewarded by First Nations and some savannas naturally succeeded to forest. Remaining savanna environments continue to be undermined by excessive human interference and the presence of intrusive plant species that tend to overtake savanna flora. Most of the remaining savanna lands in Ontario can be found on First Nations land / reserves such as Walpole Island, Six Nations, Bruce Peninsula, Manitoulin Island and Alderville.

These fields were home to crops such as corn, beans, pumpkins, and tobacco, all of which were harvested by the Onondowaga people. Mass production was no foreign concept for the Haudenosaunee; in fact, the Haudenosaunee people would organize fishing expeditions for which as many as a 1000 fish could be caught at one time. The Haudenosaunee cultivated a range of 60 different kinds of beans as well as varieties of corn.

The savanna would have had scattered stands of trees (predominantly old growth red pine trees) punctuated by large areas of shrubs and grassland. Although it looked natural, this pine savanna was in fact managed by First Nations people through periodic controlled burns to encourage animals and plants that were significant sources of food and medicine.The existence of controlled burns is encoded in one of the Anishinaabemowin names for the Don River, which was recorded in an anglicized rendering as 'Wonscontonach'.

At the meeting Johnston gifted the Mississaugas gunpowder, kettles, rum, lace hats, mirrors, and flannel. He later claimed that the gifts were payment for the requested land, a transaction that became known as the Toronto Purchase. Years later, the legitimacy of this claim came under scrutiny when the deed documenting the Toronto Purchase was discovered to be blank. The signatures of the Chiefs had been glued to the deed and the document lacked any description of the land that was supposedly sold to the Crown.  With the legality of the transaction called into question, the Crown negotiated a new agreement with the Mississaugas of the Credit in 1805. The Crown claimed that the Mississaugas willingly sold 250,830 acres of land to the Crown for 10 shillings. The land included in the purchase was bordered by Etobicoke Creek to the west, Ashbridge's Bay to the east, and 28 miles north of Lake Ontario to the north.  In 1986, the Mississaugas of the Credit challenged the fairness of the Toronto Purchase and submitted a Toronto Purchase specific claim with the Government of Canada. The Mississauga asserted that 10 shillings was an unfair purchase price for the land, that the Crown hadn't acted in good faith, and that the Crown had taken control of land beyond what was outlined in the agreement. In 2010, Government of Canada settled the case. The Mississaugas were awarded $145 million in compensation for the Toronto Purchase.

Johnston hosted many young Indigenous students in her home during this time to provide them a safe and welcoming home while they acquainted themselves to life away from home, in Toronto. The imposition of the Indian Act onto Indigenous communities by the federal government in the late 1800s disrupted Indigenous governance systems that were already in place that were well-suited to maintaining community cohesion and prosperity. This imposition of colonial control caused widespread economic depressions that Indigenous communities are still working to overcome today. This is but one of several factors that pushed many Indigenous community members across the country to seek economic opportunities in urban settings like Toronto. However, overt discrimination and systematic forms of oppression rendered many Indigenous people moving to cities vulnerable to poverty and risk. Indigenous people within cities were often disconnected from those they would call kin, and without these critical cultural, economic, and emotional support networks, it would be easier to lose one's identity and direction, or to slip into poverty. Verna Patronella's community-building work helped many Indigenous youth to be successful in the city. Verna's tireless efforts to build supports for Indigenous youth in Toronto and in her reserve community of Cape Croker earned her the title of 'Indian Woman of the Year', by the Native Women's Association in 1976.

The Humber River has its headwaters near Mono, north and west of Toronto, and snakes through Toronto before emptying into Lake Ontario at Humber Bay.  This river was part of a vast network of waterways including all the major rivers and lakes in the Great Lakes / St. Lawrence watershed, that facilitated a great deal of Indigenous movement and travel over a vast area spanning the interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean and Northern Canada to the interior of the central United States. Indigenous footprints and paddle strokes followed the paths of these innumerable waterways for millennia before the arrival of Europeans to the continent.  The Humber River Valley was particularly significant as a major portage route used by First Nations people for thousands of years to travel between Georgian Bay or Lake Simcoe and Lake Ontario. The Mississaugas called the Humber River Kabechenong, which has been variously interpreted as 'resting place,' 'leave the canoes and go back,' or 'portage'. This portage was one of the fastest inland routes that allowed one to directly cross through what is now southern Ontario, making the Humber River Valley and Toronto itself a very important and desirable area for meeting, trade and exchanging information. There are dozens of Indigenous village and campsites known to have existed within the Humber River Valley collectively representing several thousand years of Indigenous occupation in the area and attesting to the long-lived importance of this route.

The Scarborough Township purchased 225 acres of land and 145 buildings on Eglinton Avenue (the former GECo site) from the government. The farmlands on Eglinton Avenue from Victoria Park Avenue eastwards were soon transformed into the Golden Mile industrial complex. To attract businesses during Canada's post-war economic boom, the land was offered at inexpensive prices and low property taxes. Since then, the Golden Mile attracted a range of major companies, including Delco, Thermos, Frigidaire, and car manufacturers like General Motors and Volkswagen. In 1954, the Golden Mile Plaza opened at Victoria Park Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East, becoming the largest shopping centre in Canada. In 1959, the Golden Mile Plaza was even visited by Queen Elizabeth II. While the area was booming for a number of decades, many of these industries have moved out since the 1980s.

The ice sheet created a dam, which trapped water during the retreat of a melting glacier. Lake Iroquois was also fed by Early Lake Erie and Glacial Lake Algonquin (which Lake Huron would emerge from). Lake levels at that time would have been approximately 30 metres (~100 feet) higher than Lake Ontario's current level. West of the Scarborough Bluffs, the original shoreline of Lake Iroquois heads inland, running between Kingston Road and Queen Street East, eventually following the north side of what is now called Davenport Road. When the ice dam melted, the lake lowered to the level it is today.  Rising 90 metres (300 feet) above contemporary Lake Ontario, the bluffs extend approximately 15 kilometers (9.3 miles) along the shoreline from the foot of Victoria Park Avenue to Highland Creek in the east. The Bluffs are constantly eroding due to human activities like building construction, and natural forces. The process of erosion created the Toronto Islands. They were formed when alluvial deposits (loose soil, silt, and clay) from the bluffs were reshaped by water and deposited away from the mainland.

The property and the architectural fragments ornamenting the gardens were sold to the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and the Province of Ontario in 1978 to be maintained as a public park. The land is also significant for its rare tract of Carolinian forest. Today there are efforts by the City of Toronto and community organizations to protect this forested area and the animals that it supports. The park is an important site for migratory and nesting birds, and mammals such as deer and fox. A notable architectural fragment found within the park is from the Temple Building. When the original building first opened in downtown Toronto, it was one of Toronto's first skyscrapers and was the highest building in the British Empire. It housed the office of the Independent Order of Foresters (IOF). At that time, a Mohawk doctor - and one of Canada's first physicians - Dr. Oronhyatekha (or Dr. O) was the Chief Ranger of the organization.

In 1932, Rosa and Spencer Clark founded the Guild of All Arts after Rosa purchased 450 acres of land. The Guild of All Arts, mainly located in the Bickford House, was an artist colony that contained a shop, a tea room, and studios in fine art and craft, including painting, sculpture, hand loom weaving, tooled leather, ceramics, metal work, wood carving and batik. After the war, the Clarks expanded the colony to include a hotel, restaurant and formal gardens. The area became known as the Guild Inn or the Guild. During Toronto's building boom that began in the 1960s, many historic nineteenth and twentieth century downtown buildings were demolished. As an advocate for architectural preservation, Spencer Clark recovered many of these buildings' facades and architectural features and displayed them on the grounds of the Guild. The park and monuments were sold to the Metro Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1978. The hotel continued to be run by Spencer Clark until 1983.

She also became an accomplished author in the 1940s, writing 5 books, one of which won a Governor General's Literary Award.

It describes how the area was once home to many thousands of passenger pigeons. This large population was sustained by an equally large supply of seeds, acorns, and other nuts available within the vast Black Oak savanna just East of Omiimiikaa in the area of the Humber River, High Park, and Roncesvalles. Because the savannas were maintained and expanded by First Nations people through controlled burns, the historic presence of the passenger pigeons here can be linked directly to First Nations gardening practices and land stewardship. The passenger pigeon, in turn, formed a significant part of local First Nations diets and Omiimiikaa was thus an important hunting ground.  It is estimated that at the peak of their population there were five billion passenger pigeons across Turtle Island, roughly forty percent of the continent's entire bird population! Passenger pigeons were migratory, but would return to the same nesting places, like Omiimiikaa year after year. In these nesting areas, trees would sometimes have so many nests that their branches would break under the weight.  Sadly, passenger pigeons became extinct in a stunningly short period of time. With colonial expansion, so many birds were killed every season that their numbers became fewer every year. Unfortunately, at the time of settlement, they began to be hunted in excess to feed the growing population. The recognition of their endangered state came too late and the efforts to save the species were unsuccessful. The passenger pigeon was officially announced extinct in 1914.

Tecumseh was likely born circa 1768 in Chillcothe, Ohio or in nearby Kispoko village, along the Scioto River. Tecumseh's father, Pukeshinwau, was a Shawnee chief.  Tecumseh witnessed many abuses and land thefts perpetuated by American soldiers and settlers against Shawnee during his youth and when he grew older, he increasingly fought in battles against the Americans in the years following the American Revolution. He fought for Indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and freedom from American tyranny, eventually rising to prominence as an influential chief among his people. In this role he worked to unite different First Nations into a pan-Indigenous alliance against the Americans, as Pontiac, Brant, and other Indigenous leaders had done before him. He had become an inspired orator with a clear message: the First Nations overcome longstanding rivalries and work together to save their land and cultures from the common American threat.  During the War of 1812, he worked with the British against the Americans. Using guerilla-style hit-and-run and ambush tactics Tecumseh won some important victories during the war. In one famous battle in August 1812 he, alongside Sir Isaac Brock, succeeded in forcing an unopposed surrender of Fort Detroit.  Shortly after receiving an ominous premonition, Tecumseh was killed in action during the Battle of Moraviantown, on October 5, 1813. Tecumseh refused to accept tyranny, risking everything to inspire and unite many different First Nations in a common fight for sovereignty and freedom.

On April 27, 1813 the fort was attacked by a force of 2,700 American soldiers on fourteen ships. In addition to the British soldiers stationed at the fort, a force of Anishinaabe warriors helped in the defensive effort. The Anishinaabe warriors used guerilla-style tactics to snipe at the Americans while concealing their numbers and position within the trees located along the shoreline. The Americans eventually overwhelmed the fort's defenses, the fort was destroyed, and the settlement of York was looted for several days.  The fort's defenses were rebuilt, but as the defensive importance of the fort declined and with the increasing prominence of rail transportation in the 1850s, Toronto's shoreline around Fort York began to be filled in to make way for railways. All the land currently to the south of Fort York is thus land fill added since the nineteenth century. A new installation at the Visitor Center attempts to recall the original landscape that bordered the city using weathered steel panels and landscaping that align with the contours of the original shoreline.  The recreated shoreline allows visitors to contemplate the vastness of Lake Ontario, and the drastic changes that the land has undergone.

For example, during the War of 1812, 8410 Anishinaabeg warriors fought alongside the British against the Americans.  Government records estimate that over 4000 Indigenous people enlisted in the First World War, however the true number is likely much higher as Metis and First Nations people without 'Indian Status' were not recognized as Indigenous in the records. Francis Pegahmagabow was Ojibwe, a member of Wasauksing First Nation, a decorated First World War veteran, and part of the 1st Canadian Division which is commemorated in the park. He is recognized as a war hero and was the deadliest sniper of the First World War, having killed 378 enemy soldiers. Like many status Indian veterans who returned home after fighting for Canada, he was not allowed to vote in Canadian elections and was still considered to be a ward of the state by the federal government.  On the southern edge of the park is the Victory-Peace Monument. Over 3000 Indigenous people are recognized to have fought in the Second World War, however, just like in the First World War the real number is likely much higher. One of the most decorated Indigenous soldiers in Canadian history was Tommy Prince. He was Ojibwe, a member of Brokenhead Ojibway First Nation, and a residential school survivor. He earned 11 medals during his military career. He was a member of an elite unit referred to as 'the Devil's Brigade' by the Germans.

In the following year, Longboat won the Professional Champion of the World title. Long distance running in the sense of what we know it as today, was actually something that was quite different in Indigenous terms. Long distance running was not so much a sport as it was a way of life for many Indigenous People. Traveling far distances, certain individuals from each community were sometimes chosen to deliver messages and those most competent, and those with the most endurance were usually chosen to do this. It should be noted also that Six Nations invented the game of lacrosse, which is quite similar to hockey, and so it is evident that sometimes physical activity was done for leisure's sake.

It wasn't until the late 1980s that Mavor Moore's original vision came to fruition when a number of theatre companies merged together to create Canadian Stage, which has since produced over 500 shows.

This property is also located in what used to be known as The Ward. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the area was a dense slum, home to the poor and impoverished and was officially known as St. John's Ward, and was home to Toronto's first Chinatown. Filming done at Toronto City Hall includes scenes from 'The Handmaids Tale', 'The Expanse' and 'Resident Evil'. Across the way (at corner of Bay Street) is Old City Hall which officially opened in 1899 after 10 years of construction. Installed in the building is a stained glass representation of the original Toronto Coat of Arms. The City of Toronto has had at least two coats of arms. The first was created following the incorporation of the city in 1834, when the city was also renamed back to 'Toronto' from 'York'. The current Toronto coat of arms originated in 1998 when, following the amalgamation of the Greater Toronto Area, the coat of arms was updated with new iconography.  The original coat of arms consisted of a shield framed by two figures on either side, with a beaver and crown placed on top and a banner below. One of the figures, a cloaked and helmeted woman holding a trident and shield, represents Britannia, the personification of Britain. The other, a generic depiction of an eighteenth century First Nations man with a bow and axe, is presumably meant to represent the First Nations of the area of Toronto. The iconography of the shield includes a red maple leaf, gold lions, a white rose, a gear, and a steamship, representing Canada, Britain, York, and industry, respectively. On the banner are written the words, 'Industry, Intelligence, Integrity'. The references to industry and the beaver speak to Toronto's character at the time as a 'resource town' with origins in the early fur trade.  In January 1999, the current coat of arms became official. 'Diversity Our Strength' became the new city motto. A yellow shield in the centre of the design is marked by two blue lines that represent the two towers of City Hall.  The bear represents strength and protection while the beaver is included as a symbol of industry. The inclusion of the eagle acknowledges that Toronto is built on the traditional territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation, whose logo also incorporates an eagle.
